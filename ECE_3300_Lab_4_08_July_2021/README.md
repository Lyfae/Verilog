# Lab 4 - Seven Segment Display
Submitted by Group G - Paul Thai, Russell Hua and Philbert Chang

## Description
A Seven Segment display is the most common device used for displaying digits and alphabet. There are two types of seven segment: common cathodes and common anodes. Common cathode seven segment displays will turn on when the input is high and the Anode seven segment display will turn on when the input is low. There is also an eighth bit that is used to turn on and off the decimal value. Just like the A-G pins that every seven segment display has, depending of if it is common cathode and common anode, it will turn on accordingly. 

## Test-Bench Description
### Tests
For this particular lab, we did not create a test bench because we thought it would be save us more time to just run the synthesis, run the implementation and then generate the bitstream. We did start with a test bench, but we were running into errors that were not sure how to fix so we just decided to test it using the FPGA instead. The tests took a lot long than we thought, however, it allowed to realize the importance of a test bench and why it saves more time to create one than just plugging it into the FPGA and test it. Overall in this lab, it worked out finely the way we wanted it to and we are happy about it.
