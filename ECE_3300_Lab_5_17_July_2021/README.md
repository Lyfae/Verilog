# Lab 5 - Alien Calculator
Submitted by Group G - Paul Thai, Russell Hua and Philbert Chang

## Description
A calculator is a tool that quickens the the arithmetic process of having to compute by hand. In this lab, we are creating a signed calculator that will only do addition, subtraction, and multiplication from two BCD values. Due to the limited space that we have, we opted to use BCD, and we were able to create a calculator that we can use.
