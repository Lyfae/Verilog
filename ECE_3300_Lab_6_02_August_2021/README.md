# Lab 6 - Barrel Shifter
Submitted by Group G - Paul Thai, Russell Hua and Philbert Chang

## Description
A barrel shifter is a digital circuit that can shift a data word by a specified number of bits without the use of any sequential logic, but solely on combinational logic. In our lab, we are going the be shifting the data coming in from the switches by 4-bits. The reason why is because we are outputting the result to seven segment displays so it would be easier to see it if we are shifting and rotating the values by 4 bits.
