# Lab 7 - Modified Up / Down Counter
Submitted by Group G - Paul Thai, Russell Hua and Philbert Chang

## Description
In this lab, we have to take an Up and Down counter and modified it so that we could load in any BCD values and count up and down from there. In addition, there is going to be 5 switches that is going to be responsible for controlling the speed of the clock: zero being the fastest and 31 being the fastest (32 if BCD). From there it is up to us whether we should count up or count down and thats the lab!
